                <p class="info">
                    At Jersey WyldLife LLC, once an inspection is requested and scheduled, one of our wildlife removal
                    experts will
                    arrive on site at your convenience, ask a few questions and inspect your property to determine the
                    extent of any
                    damage, possible entry points, and the type of animal damaging your property.
                    Questions might include: “What have you heard, smelled or even seen?” and “How long has the problem
                    been
                    going on?” We’ll then locate all points of entry, determine the best course of action to remove the
                    nuisance
                    wildlife and provide any possible preventative measures. Often, the first places we check are the
                    attic
                    and crawl
                    spaces followed by inspecting the exterior of the building. Starting at the ground level, followed
                    by
                    the roof, to find
                    any obvious animal damage.
                    Finding them and any damage is only half the battle.
                    Once an inspection is completed and we’ve determined the best course of action, we’ll start the
                    wildlife
                    removal
                    process on your property immediately. Once the nuisance wildlife are removed, we’ll also perform any
                    recommended Preventative Maintenance options necessary to keep these animals out, along with
                    repairing
                    any
                    damage caused by them, including the attic. We’re fully equipped to remove, sanitize, and replace
                    attic
                    insulation
                    as part of our full-service Attic Environmental Clean Up.

                <h1> WILDLIFE EXCLUSION</h1>

                <p class="info">
                    Wildlife Exclusion is a multi-step process starting with a complete Property Inspection to determine
                    all points of
                    entry and to devise a plan to remove the nuisance wildlife that has invaded your home. Wildlife has
                    an innate
                    ability to survive, and in their quest for survival and comfort, animals find themselves taking
                    shelter in homes –
                    usually in attics, crawl spaces, chimneys, and even inside your walls. Raccoons, bats, squirrels,
                    and other wildlife
                    are quite resourceful, and will find their way into homes one way or another.
                    Once all the points of entry are located, exclusion devices such as one-way doors, Bat cones, Pro
                    cones, and
                    different types of excluders that allow nuisance wildlife a safe way to exit, are strategically
                    installed. In addition to
                    the installation of the exclusion devices, any openings created by the nuisance wildlife will be
                    thoroughly sealed
                    off. Jersey WyldLife LLC can also fortify your home with Preventative Maintenance after all wildlife
                    exclusion work
                    has been completed.
                    A written Warranty will be provided upon completion of all wildlife exclusion and preventative
                    maintenance work.

                <p class="info">
                    In addition to repairing openings created by nuisance wildlife in your home or business, it might be
                    necessary to
                    take other preventative measures to ensure nuisance animals don't return. Most homes are built to
                    code by
                    construction companies with little or no experience in the wildlife industry. Thus, leaving small
                    gaps, crevices and
                    openings that nuisance wildlife can take advantage of and gain entry to your home or business. There
                    are many
                    ways to prevent nuisance wildlife from gaining access such as installing Chimney Caps, Attic Vent
                    Covers, Sealing
                    Eaves, etc. Certain techniques will be more effective than others due to the intelligence and
                    adaptation levels of
                    the different nuisance animals. Jersey Wyldlife LLC is trained to quickly recognize and develop a
                    credible defense
                    plan based on the nuisance animal and their habits.

                    Life begins and ends every day, when nature takes its course and there may be unfavorable situations
                    left behind.
                    To help prevent the spread of disease and parasites of deceased animals, those carcasses need to be
                    removed.
                    Most of the time, if the deceased animal is located on public property, the local town or
                    municipality will perform
                    the necessary clean up. However, if any wildlife perishes on private property, in your walls, attic,
                    crawlspace, or
                    anywhere else on your property, it is up to the property owner to remedy the situation or call a

                <p class="info">
                    We often underestimate the danger rodents pose to our health and to our property. Rodents, such as
                    mice or rats,
                    will gain entry to a dwelling by chewing holes and/or using crevices found in homes. They leave
                    undiscovered urine
                    and feces on table surfaces, pantries and kitchen drawers, which if consumed or inhaled, may cause
                    disease. The
                    spread of the deadly Hantavirus is especially alarming. In addition, rodents may also be carrying
                    fleas, ticks and
                    mites. Rodents create nests, gnaw through wood, infest insulation, and chew wires which could
                    potentially be a
                    fire hazard. To prevent this, Jersey WyldLife LLC will thoroughly inspect your residence’s interior
                    and exterior for
                    any cracks or crevices. After a thorough Property Inspection is complete, all cracks and crevices
                    will be sealed with
                    copper mesh, silicone, cobra, or IPF foam to prevent future rodent activity. This is a great
                    preventative measure to
                    help alleviate rodents and insects from entering your home.

                <p class="info">
                    Multiple types of nuisance wildlife invade attics and other spaces in your home, and each one of
                    them presents
                    their own set of problems with damage and contamination. The one common characteristic that all
                    types of
                    wildlife infestations have is that there will always be urine, feces, nesting materials, bacteria,
                    and pheromones
                    remaining after their removal. Nuisance wildlife waste, if it remains undiscovered, can create a
                    rancid smell in
                    your home, and after time, that odor can become a biohazard. Animal waste can be disease ridden.
                    Coming in
                    contact with it can transmit Leptospirosis, Salmonellosis, Rickettsia, or even Roundworm. Bird and
                    bat feces can
                    even grow mold, which can lead to Histoplasmosis, a lung infection that can spread throughout the
                    body.
                    Due to the CDC health concerns regarding all wildlife urine and feces left behind, it is critical
                    that you have a
                    professional nuisance wildlife removal company decontaminate your attic and other possible locations
                    after
                    eliminating any wildlife infestation. This can have serious implications on the health of your home,
                    attic, family,
                    and pets if the contaminated areas are not restored to their natural conditions.
                    If you've found wild animals in your home, it's important to consider an inspection for damage and
                    waste. Contact

                    Bird guards are installed over bathroom exhaust fans and dryer vents to prevent nesting birds, such
                    as sparrows and
                    starlings, from clogging the vents with nesting material that can lead to damage or even worse, a
                    fire.

                <h1>ATTIC FAN/VENT COVERS</h1>

                <p class="info">
                    Most attic fans, roof vents, gable vents and crawl space vents are made of a plastic material with
                    simple window
                    type screening or no screening at all. Wild animals can and do chew through these vents to enter the
                    attic where
                    they can destroy wiring, cause leaks and do severe damage to your home. Keep out racoons, squirrels,
                    birds and
                    many other nuisance wildlife by installing covers on all the ventilation exits on your home.

                <h1>CHIMNEY CAPS</h1>

                <p class="info">
                    Chimneys offer warmth and shelter, which is why it can become a home to wildlife. Bats, birds,
                    raccoons, squirrels
                    and more can enter your home through the chimney. When animals enter and create a home, they may
                    deposit
                    their waste (a toxic substance) or be unable to climb out and become trapped. Commonly, trapped
                    wildlife can die
                    inside the chimney and produce a dreadful odor in your home. Chimney caps can be suited to your
                    liking as there
                    are several options such as stainless steel, copper, and black galvanized. The opening of the
                    chimney will need to
                    be measured to assure an exact fit. The cap is then tightened and sealed with a bead of caulk around
                    the base.
