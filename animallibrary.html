                        insects, and carrion. They are inactive from late fall through winter, relying during that time

                        their
                        stored food. Chipmunks are found in open forests and woodlot edges with rocky cover, but they
                        also
                        inhabit areas in and around homes. They dig extensive <b>burrows</b> in, around, and under

                    <p class="animal-info"> Incredibly adaptable, coyotes are found in
                        almost every habitat type, even in our most urban areas. Their color, size and appearance varies
                        across the
                        range, but they are usually light gray to brownish-yellow with a light gray to cream-colored
                        belly.
                        Adult
                        males in the northeastern U.S. typically weigh 40-45 pounds and females average 30-35 pounds.
                        Coyotes
                        are social animals and commonly yip, bark, and howl to communicate; however, urban dwelling
                        coyotes
                        tend to be quieter. Attacks on people are rare but increasing in
                        areas where coyotes are being fed or are accustomed to humans.

                        under
                        parts, a flattened tail and large, dark eyes for night vision. The young are born blind and
                        helpless
                        but develop more quickly than other squirrels. Tree cavities, birdhouses and building structures
                        may
                        be used as nesting sites.Â Being nocturnal, it prefers to live in colonies. During
                        the winter months they will seek shelter and take up residence in homes and they will bring
                        their
                        friends.
                        It is not uncommon to have 20 flyers living in an attic!

                        bird feeders, and gnawing holes near gutters and eaves to invade homes. They can get into

                        burrows, but will climb and swim away as well. They are active during the day and sleep at

                        and

                        the
                        size of a large house cat. Their fur ranges in color from snow white to jet black, and their

                        nearly
                        hairless and rat-like. They tend to be solitary and nomadic and are primarily nocturnal in
                        activity.
                        When
                        threatened, they bare their teeth, hiss, and/or âplay dead.â An opossum in your yard should not
                        be a
                        problem, as they are not aggressive or destructive and do not
                        attack or threaten pets or dig burrows. They are beneficial to humans because they feed on many
                        types of
                        insects, like crickets and beetles, as well as on mice and voles.

                        decks,

                    <p class="animal-info">Skunks are house cat-sized mammals native to North America. There are several
                        types of
                        skunks. The striped skunk is the most common, found in nearly all of the continental United
                        States
                        and
                        the southern half of Canada. Skunks are known carriers of rabies; therefore, any skunks observed
                        behaving abnormally or sickly
                        should be avoided. The following symptoms may indicate the presence of rabies or other
                        neurological
                        diseases in mammals: disorientation, impaired movement, paralysis or lack of coordination,
                        unprovoked
                        aggression, strange vocalizations, excess salivation, and unusually friendly behavior.

                        have a sharp, heavy bill with a chisel-like tip for chipping and digging into trees. Woodpeckers
                        mainly
                        feed on wood-boring insects, grubs, eggs, and pupae, as well as ants, wasps, and bees found on
                        trees.
                        They also consume sap, nuts, seeds, and the fruits of some trees and shrubs when insects are not
                        readily
                        available. Woodpeckers naturally roost, nest, and find food in both living and dead trees.
                        Houses
                        and buildings with wood exteriors have the
                        highest likelihood of being damaged by woodpeckers. However, they also can damage homes made of
                        stucco or similar material. Woodpeckers damage buildings by drumming and drilling.
