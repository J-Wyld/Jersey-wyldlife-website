                    <p class="animal-info">Easter chipmunks are small striped ground squirrels found
                        throughout
                        North America. They spend their time grounded, and when startled, run
                        with their tails upright. Chipmunks are diurnal (active during the day and night)
                        throughout Spring, Summer and Fall, but will rely on their food caches with minimal
                        activity during the Winter months. They primarily store and feed on acorns, nuts,
                        berries, seeds, mushrooms, and insects. When not in forests and wooded areas they
                        will find protective cover by burrowing extensive tunnels under patios, stairs, retention
                        walls, and foundations. They can enter buildings along the sill plate, through dryer
                        vents and under garage doors.

                        usually light gray to brownish-yellow with a light gray to cream-colored belly. Their
                        activity will mostly occur at night and in the early morning throughout the year, but their

                        diet will change based on the season. During the Winter and Spring, they will primarily
                        hunt the prey species that are most abundant in their territory which can consist of
                        rodents, rabbits, livestock, and sporadically eat small domestic animals. Throughout late
                        Summer and Fall, their diet consists of fruits, vegetables and different types of plant
                        material. Coyotes typically use natural sheltered areas such as burrows, hollow trees,
                        rock crevices, but could seek shelter under sheds and decks.

                    <p class="animal-info">The Flying Squirrel is the smallest squirrel in our area averaging between
                        2-3 1⁄2 ounces
                        with dense, soft fur of grayish-brown tones with a creamy-colored underside. Their most
                        distinctive characteristics are broad webs of skin connecting the fore and hind legs at
                        the wrists (to aid in gliding), large black eyes, and a flattened tail. Their diet consists of
                        acorns, hickory nuts, seeds, berries, bird eggs, tree bark, and occasionally insects.
                        Flying Squirrel sightings are rare due to their nocturnal nature. However, homeowners
                        are more likely to come in contact with flyers if they have taken up residence in your
                        attic or walls. They will gnaw on electrical wires (causing a fire hazard), and use your home as
                        a "litter box" which can lead to stains and unbearable
                        smells if left unattended.

                        crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk hours) but are also nocturnal. It is not
                        uncommon to see them foraging during the day, especially during the breeding season.
                        Foxes may find shelter under sheds, decks, abandoned woodchuck burrows, brush
                        piles and hollow trees, but can dig their own den as well.

                        tint with a
                        white underside and a bushy tail. They have an overall length of 12-20 inches including
                        the tail and weigh between 1-1.5 pounds. Their diet consists of acorns, hickory nuts,
                        walnuts, fungi, corn, tree bark, fruits and berries. During the daytime, squirrels move
                        within their home range (1-100 acres) according to the availability of food. Gray
                        squirrels typically build leaf nests or use tree cavities for denning. They will also take
                        advantage of uncapped chimneys and chew into soffits and eaves gaining access to
                        attics. Once inside, squirrels will scratch and chew wires (fire hazard), damage gable
                        vents, screens, insulation and weaken rafters by their constant gnawing.

                        daytime they move within 50-150 feet from their dens in areas such as farmlands,
                        backyards, and wooded or bushy areas. Groundhogs will deeply hibernate from the time
                        of the first heavy frost through early Spring where their burrow aids in mating, weaning
                        young, and protection. Their burrows can undermine the foundations of sheds, decks,
                        pools and walkways on a homeowner’s property.

                        long
                        scaly tail, and silver tipped fur. They can grow to a length of 26 inches and may weigh
                        up to 14 pounds. Their diet consists of mice, worms, garbage, fruit, berries, and even
                        roadkill. Although nocturnal, a nursing female searching for food can be seen during the
                        day as well as young and inexperienced opossums that are not yet streetwise.
                        Opossums are very adaptable and will thrive in nearly any habitat, from wilderness to
                        inner cities, provided that their basic necessities are available. Natural habitats include
                        hollow logs, trees, and abandoned squirrel nests, but may also seek shelter under
                        decks and sheds provided there are unused burrows.

                        black “mask”
                        over their eyes and a ringed tail. They can range in size from 16-31 inches in length and
                        can weigh anywhere between 8-20 pounds. Their diet consists of fish, frogs, small
                        mammals, snails, insects, eggs, fruits, berries, nuts, garden crops, and garbage.
                        Raccoons are nocturnal and relatively silent but may be active during the day, especially
                        in the Spring and Summer when the female is nursing and raising young. Den sites may
                        include brush piles, hollow trees, rock crevices, storm sewers and ground burrows.
                        However, in developed areas, they will also den in attics, chimneys, sheds, under decks
                        and in crawl spaces where they can threaten the health and safety of people and pets.
                        Raccoons can cause damage to lawns, gardens, attic vents, eaves, siding, insulation
                        and create fire hazards by chewing wires.

                        mainly consists of insects, earthworms, fruit, nuts, small amphibians and mammals.
                        Skunks prefer to nest in hollow logs, brush piles, and abandoned woodchuck holes.
                        They also den under decks, porches, crawl spaces and other secluded areas. They are nocturnal,
                        they become seasonally dormant during the coldest months of the
                        winter. Skunks are known carriers of rabies. Therefore, any skunks observed behaving
                        abnormally or sickly should be avoided.

                    <p class="animal-info">There are about 22 species of snakes found in New Jersey some of which
                        include
                        Eastern Garter Snake, Milk Snake, Black Rat Snake, and Northern Water Snake.

                        Snakes vary in length and color depending on age and species. In urban and suburban
                        areas they are drawn to wood piles, stone walls, gardens, and occasionally sheds,
                        garages and basements. Their diet consists of rats, mice, chipmunks, baby birds, bird
                        eggs, insects, and salamanders. By feeding on rodent and insect carriers, snakes help
                        prevent the spread of disease to people, pets, and livestock. Snakes rarely leave signs
                        of their presence, but you may notice slither tracks, shed skin or a direct sighting.

                    <p class="animal-info">New Jersey is home to 7 species of woodpeckers ranging in size from about 6-18
                        inches long. Many of these species are year round residents. Their diet mainly consists
                        of wood-boring insects, grubs, eggs, ants, wasps, bees, and pupae. Woodpeckers are
                        dependent on trees for food and shelter, but it is common to see woodpeckers nesting
                        in the side of houses, sheds, telephone poles and garages. The three main
                        woodpeckers that cause damage to homes and other manmade structures are the
                        Downy, Hairy, and Pileated woodpeckers.
